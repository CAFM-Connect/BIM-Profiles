## Intention of BTGA BIM-Profile

The BTGA profile is the result of the BIM task group, hosted by BTGA, Bundesindustrieverband Technische Gebäudeausrüstung e.V.
This group created the classification structure, stored in the profile, to provide a more or less complete classification for MEP
related BIM modeles.

This classification is based on
- extended structure following DIN 276
- the base classes covered in VDI 3805

To extend this classification, please fork the repo from [CAFM-Connect/BIM-Profiles](https://github.com/CAFM-Connect/BIM-Profiles)
and send pull requests with you extensions.

Thanks you!
