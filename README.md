## What are BIM Profiles?

A BIM profile is a digital template for the information request of a BIM application, comparable to an empty but structured form. For a successful exchange of information, the sender and recipient of the information should agree on a BIM profile in advance.

BIM profiles can be agreed as the contractual basis for the information deliveries from service performances. They are sort of a digital expression for Information Exchange Requests.

## Which informationcan be stored in a BIM Profile?

A BIM profile contains a maximum of five classifications (min. one). Each classification has one of these types, whereby a type may occur only once in a profile:
- Classification of Space Usage Types (e.g. from DIN 277-2, ISO 81346-2-Table 4)
- Classification of Object types (e.g. from CAFM-Connect, Omniclass, Uniclass, COBie)
- Classification of Document types (e.g. from GEFMA 198, GEFMA 924.60)
- Classification of Building Types (e.g. from GEFMA 924.10)
- Classification of Cost Groups (e.g. from DIN 276=

In addition, the profile can contain class related properties for master data, running data, BIM, maintenance, servicing, energy data, etc.

## In which format is the profile stored?

The BIM Profiles are expressed as an IFC file (IFC4 final), either in the file type *.ifcXML or in the file typ *.ifc.
