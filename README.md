## What are BIM Profiles?

A BIM profile is a digital template for the information request of a BIM application, comparable to an empty but structured form. For a successful exchange of information, the sender and recipient of the information should agree on a BIM profile in advance.

BIM profiles can be agreed as the contractual basis for the information deliveries from service performances. They are sort of a digital expression for Information Exchange Requests.
